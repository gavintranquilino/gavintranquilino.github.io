XOR's reversible property makes this possible; XORing the same values twice cancels out the effect, offering a simple yet reversible way to hide and retrieve one image within another. However, it's important to note that this method is not a robust encryption technique and is mainly used for educational or basic data concealment purposes."

Soon after the grant had ended, I remembered about my mom's old cutting machine, (which has been refurbished), and knew that I could make things with it. From one personal project to the next, I quickly learned how to use this thing. Ready, I started brainstorming an idea for a business.

The next step is to open the website of the screening tool. Once the tool has opened, the program follows a series of steps to fill out the screening form. The program looks for buttons to click via their respective xpath values. These xpaths are just names of certain elements of a website like buttons, text, containers, etc. Once a valid form has been filled, the program then takes a screenshot of the final page and closes the webdriver."

The program, one by one, sends an email to all the contacts in the contacts list. While this email feature is not available in the web version above, this program is open sourced on GitHub, ready for you to use."
