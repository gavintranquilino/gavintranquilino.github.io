      <h2>Rapid React? What that?</h2>
      <p>My team, 2702 Rebels, is a FIRST Robotics FRC Team.</p>
      <p>
        Every year, a new game is announced, and a team of highschool students,
        parents, and mentors work together to build robots to compete in these
        games. (Considered competitions). The competition is designed to inspire
        students to pursue careers in STEM (science, technology, engineering,
        and math) fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was part of the Intake team, responsible for brainstorming, planning,
        modelling, and constructing the part of the robot that intakes and loads
        cargo, (the balls), into the robot. I was taught basic SolidWorks and
        industry engineering principles, which I apply in my work/hobbies to
        this day.
      </p>

      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        Much of my contribution had been in the brainstorming process of the
        actual build. I was able to contrubite to some measurements and
        modelling of the actual intake subsystem in SolidWorks. Below is a
        picture of the issue I resolved with the retraction of the intake system
        inside of the frame with the previous cylinder setup.
      </p>

        ><img src="img/rapid-react3.png" alt=""
      /></a>
      <p>
        I was able to learn a touch of SolidWorks, but also using revision
        control with TortoiseSVN. A software used to let multiple people work on
        the same project, creates backups, tracks all changes and history of the
        project, and combine and merge contributions from all the members
        editing the digital model of the robot.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was particularly useful, as COVID-19 has impacted this year's build
        season, meaning that much of the work to the robot had been online, and
        meetings with other team members had to be through Google Meet and forum
        chats.
      </p>

      <h2>Robots @ CNE</h2>
      <p>
        At the time, the CNE had been open to the public since COVID. The
        Canadian National Exhibition (CNE) is an annual 18-day fair and
        exhibition held in Toronto, Canada. It features a wide range of
        attractions, including rides, games, agricultural displays, concerts,
        shopping, and food vendors offering a variety of unique and traditional
        fair foods. The CNE is a beloved tradition that draws over a million
        visitors each year.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were lucky enough to play some exhibition matches to display our
        robot to the region.

      /></a>
      <p>
        This was probably the best looking robot we have created so far. I am
        very proud of its design and its functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Design principles and hard skills aside, the friends I have made along
        the way has solidified my love and passion for engineering as a whole.
        This community that has been curated over the years has led me to
        believe that I am and will be an engineer in the future.
