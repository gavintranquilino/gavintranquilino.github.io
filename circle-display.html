      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Make a portable handheld virtual pet that can support higher quality
        images on a round display.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current plan is to turn my stuffed animals into virtual pets I can
        take around with me as if it were a Tamagotchi.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also a fan of the idea to introduce various sensors and an IMU to
        increase possible interactions with my pets.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this is really cool to carry around as a wearable and fun to
        showcase to others as well.
      </p>

      <h2>3D Models</h2>
      <h3>Mobile Scanner</h3>
      <p>
        I think it's cool to be able to interact with actual 3D pets, so I
        started with a scan of my panda stuffed animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used <a href="https://poly.cam/" target="_blank">Polycam</a>, a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry" target="_blank"
          >photogrammetry</a
        >
        3D scanner for mobile, to scan my panda Kumi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Polycam gives iirc about 15 free scans, so this was just enough for my
        purposes if I wanted to scan more.
      </p>
      <p>
        My Pixel 6a does not support LiDAR like the iOS counterparts, so using
        photogrammetry which is a method of using images and stitches them
        together to create a 3D model of an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the same technology that Google uses for
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suo_aUTUpps" target="_blank"
          >Google Earth</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course this comes with its limitations as it has trouble scanning
        dark, shiny, or clear areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        My solution to this was to ensure good lighting by having a lamp
        overhead and just go around my desk for each scan.

      <h2>Round Display</h2>
      <p>I wanted a circular display for my virtual pet.</p>
      <p>It's like a little portal to view my pet.</p>
      <p>
        I opted for the
        <a href="https://dronebotworkshop.com/gc9a01/">GC9A01</a> 1.28" TFT LCD
        display module (240 x 240px)
      </p>
      <p>
        I got this LCD since it's not power hungry, and also a small size good
        enough for handheld.
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, I got the display with the pin headers for debugging, but in
        the future I am planning to get ones with either the JST connectors or
        ribbon connectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used the
        <a href="https://github.com/bitbank2/AnimatedGIF">AnimatedGIF</a>
        library to play GIFs from flash memory. I am planning to read GIFs from
        storage like a microSD card in the future.

      <h2>Current Goals</h2>
      <p>
        With the current configuration, I have an IMU setup, I am hoping to be
        able to move the panda model freely as I rotate the device.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also am looking at other image libraries such as LGVL for 2D stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another plan is using a rotary encoder around the display to be able to
        interact with the circular nature of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        A battery management system is also a concern, I do have various sizes
        of LiPo batteries that I am able to tinker with, but I am going to try
        to research on souces that use ESP32 for handheld devices as using this
        as an assistant as well would be cool.
      </p>
      <p>Stay tuned for future updates to this project!</p>
