      <h2>Python Discord Code Jam 2023</h2>
      <p>
        I participated in the Python Discord Code Jam, an annual event that
        provides an opportunity for individuals to collaborate on coding
        projects. A Code Jam is essentially a competition where participants are
        grouped into teams and given a specific programming task and theme to
        guide their project. They have a limited time frame, usually a little
        over a week, to create the best possible project based on the given
        theme and requirements.
        <br /><br />
        In the context of the Python Discord Code Jam, this event focuses on
        fostering creativity, teamwork, and coding skills. It's a chance for
        developers to work together to create innovative and exciting projects,
        often with a specific focus or theme, as was the case with this year's
        theme of "Secret Codes" and the use of image manipulation tools. Code
        Jams are not only about competition but also a great opportunity for
        learning, collaboration, and having fun with coding.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <p>
        To participate in the Python Discord Code Jam, I had to complete a
        qualifier task. This task involved rearranging tiles in an image based
        on specific rules. The goal was to ensure that the provided input
        allowed for a valid rearrangement. I had to implement functions to check
        if the tile size divided the image size without remainders and if the
        provided ordering used each input tile exactly once. This qualifier task
        tested my skills in image manipulation and validation logic and was a
        prerequisite for participating in the Code Jam event.

      <h2>Our Project</h2>
      <p>
        Benevolens is an automatic secret code translation tool! It's main
        functionality consists on passing an image with a secret code somewhere
        on it, then benevolens will create a new image that contains the decoded
        text.
        <br />
        The program uses Tesseract to read text from images using Optical
        Character Recognition (OCR). Using steganography and text ciphers,
        benevolens inputs physical images of handwritten text, and can decode it
        according to some cipher. This text is generated by the tool itself.
        <br />
        Benevolens does have a Command-Line Interface (CLI) which makes the tool
        quick and easy to use and set up. Hidden messages can be stored by hand
        in handwritten notes, and quickly deciphered using the tool.
      </p>

      <h2>Optical Character Recognition</h2>
      <p>
        Benevolens inputs an image that contains some encoded (handwritten) text
        and outputs and image with that section translated.
        <br /><br />
        Using a random (or generated) noise cipher image, or a seed, text is
        read from an image and parsed using that cipher.
      </p>

      /></a>
      <br />

      <h2>Steganography (second feature)</h2>
      <p>
        Image steganography is a technique of hiding secret information or data
        within an image without altering its visible appearance to the human
        eye. In other words, it's a way to embed hidden messages or content
        within an image so that it appears like a normal image to casual
        observers. This can be achieved by subtly modifying the image's pixel
        values or other data while preserving the image's overall visual
        integrity. Image steganography is often used for secure communication
        and data concealment.
        <br /><br />
        Using XOR images for steganography involves taking two original images,
        performing a bitwise XOR operation between them to create a third image.
        This third image serves as a hidden container. What's intriguing is that
        you can XOR one of the original images with this container to reveal the
        other original image. XOR's reversible property makes this possible;
        XORing the same values twice cancels out the effect, offering a simple
        yet reversible way to hide and retrieve one image within another.
        However, it's important to note that this method is not a robust
        encryption technique and is mainly used for educational or basic data
        concealment purposes.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      </a>
      <p>
        When you XOR (exclusive OR) two images, you perform a pixel-wise
        operation between the corresponding pixels of the two images. XOR is a
        bitwise operation that compares the binary representation of each pixel
        in the two images. The result is a new image where each pixel is the
        result of applying the XOR operation to the pixels of the original
        images at the same position.
        <br /><br />
        The XOR operation is commonly used in steganography and other
        applications to manipulate the binary data of images. It can be a way to
        hide or reveal information within images, as it alters the pixel values
        in a reversible manner.
