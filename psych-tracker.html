      <h2>HackTheNorth 2023</h2>
      <p>
        I had an incredible experience at HackTheNorth, Canada's largest
        hackathon. The event, the University of Waterloo, brought together 1,000
        hackers from Canada and around the world. The HTN team did an amazing
        job, celebrating their 10th anniversary with custom stickers and unique
        digital tickets.
      </p>

        ><img src="img/psych-tracker2.png" alt="All the stickers I got"
      /></a>
      <p>
        On top of trying to collect all the swag from the sponsors, I attended
        workshops and activities, including the OpenAI, intro to embedded
        systems, and hacking the brain workshops. With the help of lots of
        snacks, a couple cups of coffee, and maybe an energy drink or two, I
        must say that the 36 hours of hacking flew by. This was an experience I
        would never forget meeting the countless people that simply either
        wanted to grow their network, build a project over a weekend, collect
        some swag, or a little bit of everything. Looking forward to the next!

      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
      <p>
        Have you ever had days when you wished you could log how you're feeling,
        especially when dealing with the challenges of mental health? Mental
        well-being can be a complex journey, and finding the right tools to
        navigate it can be even tougher. But what if there was a simple metric
        that could help you gain clarity on those difficult days? When anxiety
        or stress seem overwhelming, it's easy to lose sight of the bigger
        picture. Imagine having the ability to track and understand your
        emotional state in a straightforward way. When I faced my own mental
        health struggles, I yearned for a clear way to measure my well-being and
        communicate it effectively to professionals. Experience is subjective,
        but data can provide that much-needed clarity.

        Introducing Psyche Tracker, a revolutionary project inspired by the
        charm of WALL-E and designed to be your personal friend for managing
        emotions, stress, and focus. Like a trusted companion, Psyche Tracker
        records your moods and facial expressions, helping you gain a deeper
        understanding of your mental well-being. With the ability to analyze
        mood, temperature, and focus, this device becomes your ally in the
        journey to emotional balance and improved mental health. Psyche Tracker
        aims to provide the support and insights you need, just like a friendly
        robot friend, to help you navigate the ups and downs of life.

      <h2>What it does</h2>
      <p>
        This devices records your mood whenever you feel like recording it.
        There are three mood options to choose: high, neutral, and low. While
        this measure is coarse, it also allows the user to choose quickly
        without overthinking or being overwhelmed by options. This device also
        records this data with only the tap of a button that does not require
        the use of a cellphone. This was sought intentionally, as personal
        devices are often filled with distracting or distressing notifications.
        Sometimes it's useful just to check in without struggling to find the
        energy or wade through a sea of distractions.
        <br /><br />
        The device also features two buttons related to focus. Another common
        mental health issue is feeling regularly unfocused. This can easily
        spiral into assuming it is impossible to focus, when perhaps there was a
        great deal of energy put towards focusing recently. This is also a
        valuable metric to track for a student's mental health.
        <br /><br />
        This devices has a few additional data collection points. There is a
        mounted camera that has been trained to assess mood based on facial
        expression. There is also a temperature sensor meant to capture skin
        temperature during mood recording. Together, the mood, temperature, and
        facial expression are meant to feed into a larger algorithm. This data
        was stored using Mongo and then prepared for eventual use in a neural
        network as well as Mongo Atlas. Overtime, more associations could be
        made that will further aid in understanding the effects mental health
        has. How valuable would it be to gain insight as to ones mental state by
        a correlation with a non invasive temperature measurement?

      <h2>How we built it</h2>
      <p>
        We focused on using open source materials so that we could focus on
        creating a cohesive unit. The system is controlled by a raspberry pi 3
        and an arduino leonardo. The computer vision model was developed using
        tensorflow. The housing was created primarily with laser cut pieces with
        some fanciful 3d printed additions.
        <br /><br />
        We wanted to make this device functional, but we also wanted to make it
        pleasant. The camera is mounted on a spring to create a "bobble head" to
        amuse the user during a mental health episode. There are LEDs in the
        shape of hearts that light up when the user indicates that their mood is
        low. The two robot arms have unique movements that respond to the
        neutral mood indicator and focus mode.
        <br /><br />
        We wanted this device to feel like something of a companion. A cute
        enhancement to a desk space that provides valuable insights about the
        user.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
      <p>
        Primarily time. There are some integration steps not yet implemented due
        to a lack of time. We tried to dream feasibly, but still managed to get
        caught up in what we wanted this to be.
        <br /><br />
        Specifically, the computer vision model took it's time to train. This is
        not surprising but difficult to mitigate. It is difficult to speed up
        training and maintain model integrity.
        <br /><br />
        There were a few errors along the way! Design choices that were
        abandoned part way through because while they were desired, they were
        taking more time than could be allotted.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>My contribution</h2>
      <p>
        Focused on ensuring the creation of robust and durable electrical
        connections and circuitry for the button inputs, integrating a
        temperature sensor into the device for skin temperature data collection,
        and assisting this 3-member team to complete the project within a tight
        36-hour timeframe while ensuring successful hardware and machine
        learning integration.

      <h2>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h2>
      <p>
        We are proud of the functionality of our project and of how much we
        learned. Our design is well made given the time constraints and should
        already stand up to extended use. Furthermore, we set the ground work
        for alot of further development. The analysis of the harvested data
        could lead to much more exploration in the realm of passive mental
        health assessment.
        <br /><br />
        We're proud of how we operated as a team. None of us knew eachother
        before this, but we were able to come together and communicate
        effectively to create a project we're all quite satisfied with.
      </p>

      /></a>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>What we learned</h2>
      <p>
        We learned how to generate ideas together. We learned new technologies
        that we hadn't used before - specifically implementing interrupts for
        the buttons was an interesting endeavour! We learned how to design
        mechanically well during a hackathon - and the answer is laser cutting.
        3D printing is glamorous, but the speed of laser cutting simply can't be
        beat. We learned to get creative with what we had on hand. We found it
        difficult to check out the hardware items we were looking for and so we
        needed to get creative with what we had.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>What's next for Psych Tracker</h2>
      <p>
        More design iterations. There are little aspects of many parts of the
        build that could be improved. Finetuning what we have done so far will
        go a long way to elevate this project into something truly special.
        After that, the project would benefit from more sensors that have
        investigated links to mental health. Then, all of that data can come
        together to create the data set describing the physical effects of
        mental health on a day to day basis.
