      <h2>Skills Ontario Robotics Competition 2023</h2>
      <p>
        The Skills Ontario Competition is a prestigious event held annually in
        Ontario, Canada, that provides a platform for top students to showcase
        their skills and expertise in various vocational and technical fields.
        This competition spans over two and a half days and attracts
        participants, educators, families, and potential employers. Participants
        aim to prove that they are the best in their respective fields,
        competing in a wide range of skill-based contests.

      <h2>Making the robot</h2>
      <p>
        I played a pivotal role in the Skills Ontario Robotics Competition.
        While it was rooted in VEX robotics, our team took an unconventional
        approach.
      </p>

      <h2>Building from the Ground Up</h2>
      <p>
        Rather than relying on VEX robotics kits, we decided to construct every
        component from scratch. We used 3-phase motors, drill batteries, and
        even fabricated our aluminum chassis for the robot. Managing the robot's
        electronics was a major task. It operated wirelessly and could connect
        to Bluetooth PS2 controllers. Arduino boards powered it, and every piece
        had to be soldered meticulously.
        <br /><br />
        We undertook the intricate task of understanding each electronic
        component and how they intricately interacted. Our responsibilities
        extended to coding each module from the ground up. But it didn't stop
        there. We took on the monumental challenge of drawing the circuit
        diagram entirely by hand. This comprehensive hands-on approach was the
        most immersive engineering experience we could have ever hoped for.
      </p>

      <br /><br />

      <h2>Facing Challenges and Time Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        Given that our entire team was in grade 12, busy with college and
        university applications, we had limited time for the project. We
        dedicated an hour or two after school, once or twice a week. However, as
        the deadline loomed closer, we had to be excused from classes for an
        entire day to make progress. Integrating various components into a
        functional robot was one of our most significant challenges.

      <h2>Overnight Hotel Room Overhaul</h2>
      <p>
        Upon completing the robot, we traveled to the Skills Competition in
        Toronto. Unfortunately, the robot stopped working upon arrival,
        seemingly due to a malfunction with the dual H-bridge drivers for the
        3-phase motors. We spent an entire night in a hotel room, soldering, hot
        gluing, and debugging the robot. Initially, only our jokingly named
        autonomous robot was functional. The competition days were filled with
        debugging and resoldering every part of the robot. We had to drill new
        holes and ensure every connection was correct. It transformed into a
        36-hour marathon, resembling a hackathon.
      </p>

      <h2>Competition and Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        Despite using non-standard components and hastily assembling the robot,
        we dared to challenge other bots, most of which were using VEX kits and
        were more optimized. While we didn't secure the first place, we didn't
        come in last, and eventually, we got our 3-phase motor drivers to work.

      <h2>My Contribution</h2>
      <p>
        I not only comprehended the circuit diagram but also grasped the
        mechanics of the 3-phase motors. I led our group in working on the
        mechanical, electrical, and software components. The experience was
        intensely hands-on and felt more like a collaborative effort among high
        school students than a mentorship.

      <h2>Exploring Toronto and Unplanned Adventures</h2>
      <p>
        On the last day, instead of witnessing the final matches (since we
        didn't make it to the finals), we embarked on an adventure to explore
        Toronto. We visited the iconic CN Tower, strolled around the
        rain-drenched city, savored boba tea and Vietnamese cuisine, and
        returned to our hotel just in time for curfew. We ordered a lavish feast
        through DoorDash, spent the evening listening to a "Where's Waldo"
        audiobook, played numerous Jackbox games, and, most importantly, engaged
        in countless rounds of Secret Hitler.
      </p>
      <br /><br />

      <h2>Pranks and Laughter in the Hotel</h2>
      <p>
        But that's not where the fun ended. After returning to the hotel, we
        realized that some of our friends had fallen asleep early.
        Spontaneously, we decided to play a lighthearted prank on them. We
        gathered every single item we could find in the hotel room, from pillows
        to chairs, ironing boards to pots, plates, glasses, and more, and began
        stacking them on top of our slumbering friend. The result was a towering
        spectacle of absurdity that left everyone in stitches. It was a moment
        of camaraderie, humor, and mischief that capped off an exceptional
        journey.

      <h2>Custom Patches</h2>

        <img src="img/hockey-robot/patches.jpg" alt="patches" width="200"/>
      </a>
      <p>
        We designed custom patches to commemorate our journey and honor our
        mentor. The patches feature our robot, an orange ball symbolizing the
        game we played, and a 15-tooth gear for May 1st, our competition day. A
        crown represents our unique victory, and blue and white showcase our
        school colors. The tagline "No Kit Needed" embodies our philosophy of
        building from scratch and learning along the way.
