This project involved designing and building an instrumented crutch that could measure and provide feedback on weight bearing during rehabilitation.</description></item><item><title>Dishwasher &lt;br> Magnets üßºüçΩÔ∏è</title><link>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/dishwasher-magnets/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/dishwasher-magnets/</guid><description>Preview The Problem At home, the dishwasher can either have dirty dishes, clean dishes, or currently running.
There have been countless times that one of us in the house put dirty dishes when the dishwasher had clean ones, or someone accidentally opened the dishwasher in the middle of its current cycle.
How can we tell whether or not the dishwasher was clean, dirty, or still running?
Initial Solutions For the first few weeks since we realized this was a recurring problem, my mom placed a sticky note that says the dishes were clean.</description></item><item><title>&lt;strong>Custom Tamagotchi&lt;/strong></title><link>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/circle-display/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/circle-display/</guid><description>The Goal Make a portable handheld virtual pet that can support higher quality images on a round display.
My current plan is to turn my stuffed animals into virtual pets I can take around with me as if it were a Tamagotchi.
I am also a fan of the idea to introduce various sensors and an IMU to increase possible interactions with my pets.
I think this is really cool to carry around as a wearable and fun to showcase to others as well.</description></item><item><title>Calendar Compare üìÖ</title><link>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/calendar-compare/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/calendar-compare/</guid><description>Calendar Compare üìÖ Sign in with google, import your calendars and find when you and your friends are free!

The premise is simple, if you were in a hostage situation where calling 911 on your phone is too risky, you could use a blink detection system to call for help.
The idea started off as a joke. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen TikToks where people made the wildest videos and in the comments, they ask if they were forced to make the lame video and if they could blink twice if they need help.</description></item><item><title>&lt;strong>Mechanical Engineering&lt;/strong> @ Sheartak Tools</title><link>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/sheartak/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/sheartak/</guid><description>Overview I worked on&amp;hellip;

This ruins the lawn right where the water is dumped.

Like many other great businesses, Cravin&amp;rsquo; Vinyls once started as an idea, a motive, a thought.

This program is a project I designed to quickly fill out the COVID-19 Screening Tool. Every time I went to school, I had to fill out the COVID-19 Screening Form as a proof that I can enter the building. The questions on the form are very straightforward and common sense. While this program is not intended to lie on the form, this was created to speed up the process of having to fill out a valid form every day.</description></item><item><title>&lt;strong>Remote-controlled&lt;/strong> LED</title><link>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/remote-led/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/remote-led/</guid><description>Project Demonstration Source Code #include &amp;lt;IRremote.h&amp;gt; #define MAX_TIME 150 IRrecv irrecv(6); decode_results results; long lastPressTime = 0; long ON_BUTTON = 16753245; long B_ONE = 16724175; long red = 255; long green = 255; long blue = 255; int redPin = 9; int greenPin = 10; int bluePin = 5; bool state = false; void RGB_colour(int red_val, int green_val, int blue_val) { // Function to output RGB values analogWrite(redPin, red_val); analogWrite(greenPin, green_val); analogWrite(bluePin, blue_val); } void setup() { Serial.</description></item><item><title>&lt;strong>Motion Sensor&lt;/strong></title><link>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/motion-sensor/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.gavintranquilino.com/motion-sensor/</guid><description>Project Demonstration This project was directly inspired by Paul McWhorter.

Instead of flipping coins or using a random number website as suggested, I decided to write my own program to generate the patterns digitally.
