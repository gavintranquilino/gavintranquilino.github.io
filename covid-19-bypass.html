      <h2>What does it do?</h2>
      <p>
        This program is a project I designed to quickly fill out the
        <a href="https://covid-19.ontario.ca/school-screening/"
          >COVID-19 Screening Tool</a
        >. Every time I went to school, I had to fill out the COVID-19 Screening
        Form as a proof that I can enter the building. The questions on the form
        are very straightforward and common sense. While this program is
        <i>not</i> inteded to lie on the form, this was created to speed up the
        process of having to fill out a valid form every day. I designed this
        program using Python and the selenium library.

        If you can't already tell, this is satire. I'm not actually sick nor did
        I get anyone sick. Though, the Python script is pretty sick tbh.

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
        This program uses <a href="https://python.org/">Python</a> and a few
        third-party libraries such as, selenium, smtplib, and email. The
        selenium library is a web testing tool to run scripts and commands on a
        browser. This library is used in this program to handle the actions on
        the screening tool like opening the website, pressing buttons, etc. The
        smtplib and email libraries are both used together to handle sending
        automated emails to the users that are listed in the config files.
      </p>
      <p>
        On startup, the program opens a "webdriver", which is just fancy for
        "broswer for robots" as it allows commands and scripts to be ran on
        specific elements of a website. The next step is to open the website of
        the screening tool. Once the tool has opened, the program follows a
        series of steps to fill out the screening form. The program looks for
        buttons to click via their respective xpath values. These xpaths are
        just names of certain elements of a website like buttons, text,
        containers, etc. Once a valid form has been filled, the program then
        takes a screenshot of the final page and closes the webdriver.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the webdriver has been closed, the program then connects to an
        email address of the user's choice. Then, an SMTP connection to the
        email address will be created. After the connection, the program reads
        the email template and contacts list in order to find all the email
        addresses to send the screenshot to. The program, one by one, sends an
        email to all the contacts in the contacts list. While this email feature
        is not available in the web version above, this program is open sourced
        on
        <a href="https://github.com/gavintranquilino/ontario-covid19-screening-bypass"
          >GitHub</a
        >, ready for you to use.
