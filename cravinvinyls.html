      <h2>Cravin' Vinyls?</h2>
      <p>
        Like many other great businesses, Cravin' Vinyls once started as an
        idea, a motive, a thought. I remember hearing about a small business
        grant for at least $1000 during COVID and wondered, "I should totally
        give this a shot!" Unfortunately, all my previous ideas for products and
        services quickly came to an abrupt stop. Soon after the grant had ended,
        I remembered about my mom's old cutting machine, (which has been
        refurbished), and knew that I could make things with it. From one
        personal project to the next, I quickly learned how to use this thing.
        Ready, I started brainstorming an idea for a business. The small
        business grant may be over, but I remembered the very reason why I
        wanted to start. I wanted to gain valuable experiences and immerse
        myself into the world of business and marketing. From that moment on,
        Cravin' Vinyls has been my very first attempt at a small business/side
        hustle.

      <h2>Exploration Phase</h2>
      <p>
        I embarked on this journey by tinkering with a cutting machine designed
        for cake decorating, known as Baker's Craft. My initial experiments
        involved cutting out paper pictures of friends. The discovery that I
        could project their shadows onto my walls using a simple lamp opened up
        a world of possibilities.

      <h2>Evolution of Ideas</h2>
      <p>
        My initial experimentation with paper soon transitioned into using
        stickers, which I applied to night lights. While I tried various night
        light designs, I eventually settled on a clear acrylic square that
        worked perfectly with vinyl stickers.

      </a>

      <h2>Growing the Business</h2>
      <p>
        I initiated my venture by sharing my designs with friends and family,
        gradually expanding my customer base. As interest grew, I decided to set
        up an Etsy store. Positive reviews and increased recognition from
        customers across Canada motivated me to deal with logistics, handle a
        growing number of orders, and offer customization.

      <h2>Venturing into Clothing Design</h2>
      <p>
        My exploration didn't stop at night lights and stickers. I delved into
        clothing design, experimenting with dropshipping through itemshop.club.
        Initially, I considered rebranding and tried various platforms, but the
        expected growth didn't materialize. Instead of rebranding, I merged
        ItemShop's clothing offerings into CravinVinyls. Today, I provide a
        range of shirts featuring anime, memes, pop culture references, and
        more. Some of my most successful promotional videos are still on TikTok.

      <h2>Establishing Passive Income</h2>
      <p>
        I've streamlined my operations, enabling customers to easily order
        shirts from my Etsy page. Automation allows them to choose from designs
        I've already created. While I continue to craft vinyl sticker lights to
        order, it's truly rewarding to receive feedback and reviews from
        satisfied customers.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        My journey has been quite an adventure. I've successfully managed a
        diverse business specializing in sticker decals, nightlights, and
        clothing sales. This experience enhanced my customer service skills and
        social media marketing expertise, particularly on Instagram and
        itemshop.club. Managing finances and handling budgeting were essential
        for sustainable growth. As an entrepreneur, I developed adaptability,
        creativity, and problem-solving skills. Efficient business operations
        streamlined order fulfillment. Through all these efforts, I've built a
        strong brand presence, attracting a loyal customer base who appreciate
        the quality products and service provided by Cravin' Vinyls.
